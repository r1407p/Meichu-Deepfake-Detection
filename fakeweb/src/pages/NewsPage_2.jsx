                        Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt on Sunday, a mere two months after the Republican presidential nominee was shot in the ear at a rally in Butler.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        There were no bullets fired by the suspect in Sunday's incident, thanks to what the Secret Service has labelled as a "hyper vigilant" agent who spotted a gun muzzle poking out from bushes at Trump's Florida golf course.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        The suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, faced court today and was charged with federal gun crimes. He could potentially face more charges.

                        <p>The FBI is investigating Routh's social media accounts, which show a man with a strong focus on the war in Ukraine. The 58-year-old also has a criminal history dating back to the 1990s.

                        In his first public comments since the most recent incident, Trump described hearing "four or five shots" in a live event on X on Monday evening. "The Secret Service did a great job," he said, blaming "political foes" for "rhetoric" that preceded the shooting.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        There have been bi-partisan calls to better protect presidential candidates after this second disturbing incident in a matter of weeks. And there still 49 days until the presidential election.
